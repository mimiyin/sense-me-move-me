# Course Description

A re-working of [Choreographic Interventions](https://github.com/mimiyin/Choreographic-Interventions) (Spring 2016), this class is intended for anyone interested in using sensing technologies and movement to create interactive experiences.

We are surrounded by interfaces where swipes and taps control elements on a screen. Less familiar are systems designed to compel us to move in new and unexpected ways. How do you make someone feel soft inside? How do you shake an entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers?

Every class, we will move in order to push the boundaries of how you think you're capable of moving while experimenting with computational methods for building interactions that excite our curiosity, engage our whole body and provide an outlet for expression through movement.

We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various motion-tracking technologies, from "traditional computer vision" (blobs, contours, faces) to "new CV" (Kinect skeletons and 3D depth maps) to motion capture suits. What is the gap between what we can see and feel in our bodies as we move (strength, softness, contortion) and what a computer can sense and interpret (locations, contours, skeletons, velocity, acceleration)?

Pre-requisites: Introduction to Computational Media or its equivalent.

The course is organized around 3 ways of understanding motion:

1. Pathways
2. Form
3. Space

Assignments will consist of a series small studies exploring each topic. Some we will work on together in class. Others you will complete as homework assignments. The class will culminate in a final project and showing.

Because course topics are organized around parameters of movement, technical topics will be introduced and built upon week to week.

- What do cameras see? RGB v. IR
- Kinect Skeletons
- "Traditional" CV: Blob, Contours and Faces
- Kinect Depth Maps
- Perception Neuron: Gravity-based motion capture suits

"Soft Skills" we will practice:

- Moving
- Sketching movement ideas.
- Defining rule sets for movement.
- Deconstructing movement into parameters for code.
- Extracting movement ideas from code.
- Designing "conversational" interactions in code.

## Grading

- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 40% for topic studies.
- 20% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.
